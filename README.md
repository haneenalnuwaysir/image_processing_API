# Image Processing API

Image Processing API is about resize the width & height for image in URL and should immediately see the  modified image in screen


###  To run the project: 

```bash 
   npm run build
```
####  Then use the following url :
```bash 
   http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=palmtunnel&width=200&height=200
```
 #### When you modify the width and height, the image processing code will resize the image accordingly and save the resized image to the specified file path ```(images/thumbnail/palmtunnel.jpg ```. The new image file will reflect the changes made to the width and height.
